<h2>Coaching From Essence</h2>
<h3>https://www.futurosity.com </h3>

<p>The first few things I notice are Robert Ellis at the navigation bar and then
a picture of, presumably, Robert Ellis. Who is this guy? Scroll down and I see,
ah, he's the founder of Coaching From Essence. The paragraph goes into his background
and why he wrote this book. The domain is Futurosity, but the page makes no mention 
of that word, so I'm confused there.</p>

<p>To move through the page, you scroll down a lot. I'm not usually a fan of this
scheme. The next section is about the book and has a link to read the first ten chapters
or buy it on Amazon. The links at the top scroll you down through the sections: about, book,
community, and connect. There are a few book reviews you can page through, a link to 
"Join the Community" and then links to social media profiles. </p>

<p>Typically links in the header will navigate you to different pages, so I was 
a bit odd to just be scrolled down to another section. But it makes sense, the 
website does feel like it was put together by Robert himself on WordPress, but 
that's ok.  </p>

<p>The large image of Robert at the top does confuse me. I also don't like how when you scroll 
all the way to the top, you get an empty section, and then half the picture is cut off.
I just don't like moving through the topics by scrolling. I think the rest of the elements
are alright, paging through the reviews with the arrows is a bit annoying, like I'm not reading 
all that. </p>

<p>The loading time was quite good, actually. I expect this is because the page is relatively
small. The colors were quite nice. We do need to find a better place for that 
picture. The "About" heading was so relatively small and a lighter weight
that I didn't notice it until just now. The sections have a pattern of having a smaller 
lighter-weight title, and then a bold, large subtitle. <br>
<br>
The first "subtitle" is quite long and then changes 
to a lighter font to introduce the title of the advertised book, which detracts from the most important information:
what book you're selling. This seems to be because that section of the subtitle is also a hyperlink. 
I clicked on it on accident; it's not clear it's a link, and it's a weird place to put a link.</p>

<p>The navigation bar was alright; it didn't navigate to a separate page, it just scrolled you to 
the relevant section. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. I feel my instinct is to read through 
the entire page, then use the navigation bar, but in this case the navigation bar ends up being 
redundant.The page did have a consistent style and feel. I'm not a fan of the style, but it was 
very consistant.</p>

<p>The page responded alright to adjust the window size, but at about half width the "Read the first ten chapters" button has the text falling off.
The site uses two columns for its paragraphs, and one of the columns has an image nested in the text. So as you're adjusting the 
page, you run into a situation where a section of that column's text is the width of the word "executive".
That section of text feels too skinny even at normal size. The links on the navigation bar disappear at a smaller size as
well. </p>

<p>My main take away is that I found the image at the top confusing; you enter the website, and all the information you have is a name and a picture.
So that was certainly unusual, and to be fair, it did intrigue me. </p>
